                    <p>
                      Hi, I'm Victoria, or simply Vika. I am very passionate,
                      creative and at the same time multitasking, well-organised
                      person with high attention to detail. I found my interest
                      to web development when I took a SheCodes course in 2022.
                      My passion with coding increased while learning new skills
                      and building exciting responsive web pages and
                      applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I am versatile person, and I combine creativity and
                      logical thinking therefore I tried everything that
                      interests me. I studied architecture while living in
                      Russia. In 2014, I moved to London to develop my musical
                      skills and to complete a bachelor's and master's degree in
                      Music Business. For several years I have been working as a
                      sales manager, and in addition, writing and releasing
                      music as an artist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At the moment, as a front-end-developer I am excited to
                      continue learning and developing my skills in SheCodes
                      Responsive course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
